# Write a program where the program chooses a number between 1 and 100. The player is then asked to enter a guess. 
# If the player guesses wrong, then the program gives feedback and ask to enter an other guess until the guess is correct.
# Make the range customizable (ask for it before starting the guessing).

import random

number = random.randint(1, 100)
print( "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100")
